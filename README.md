CSMA/CD and 802.11(CSMA/CA) testing with NS

#CPSC 4317 Group Project (CSMA/CD and 802.11(CSMA/CA) evaluation with NS)

The goal of this project is to show how CSMA/CD and 802.11(CSMA/CA) protocols perform under certain conditions and parameters using NS. 
By achieving this goal, we hope to gain more insight about these two protocols.

NOTE: What should happen under the "How to run the project and what to expect" sections may differ from the desired scenario described under the "Running...with NS2 (ideal) scenario" sections.

#How to run the project and what to expect (802.11(CSMA/CA) with NS2)
1. Begin compiling the program
2. A popup with the animated simulation should pop up. You can play it to see how the nodes interact with each other as they change positions. Notice how the sender nodes are unable to communicate with the receiver node if they're too far apart.

#Running CSMA/CD with NS2 (ideal scenario)
1. Program will start up and begin executing
2. A popup with the animated simulation of this protocol will pop up. This can be played by the user similar to a video.
3. A graph showing the throughput levels through the out simulation's run time will pop up.
4. By this point, the program should be finished. Therefore, this run can be considered a success.
