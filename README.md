CSMA/CD and 802.11(CSMA/CA) testing with NS

#CPSC 4317 Group Project (CSMA/CD and 802.11(CSMA/CA) evaluation with NS)

The goal of this project is to show how CSMA/CD and 802.11(CSMA/CA) protocols perform under certain conditions and parameters using NS. 
By achieving this goal, we hope to gain more insight about these two protocols.

#How to run the project and what to expect (802.11(CSMA/CA) with NS)
1. Begin compiling the program

#Running CSMA/CD with NS (ideal scenario)
1. Program will start up and begin executing
2. ...
3. By this point, the program should be finished. Therefore, this run can be considered a success.
